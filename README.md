Love Thy Neighbor has been helping the homeless in Denver for several years now

For them it is not just about providing a meal, socks or supplies
it is about getting out and having a conversation with those in need. 

We decided they deserved some people to give back to them. 

We are taking their worpress site and rebuilding it using....

-React.js / NEXT.js
-Sass
-Stripe
-Facebook Developer Interface for Instagram and 
-Figma

All Professionally Designed and Tested. 

We hope you enjoy our code and look forward to our completed project.
